### SUBSCRIPTION of the APIs
This lab is planned in such way that, we are using three different APIS for the demonstration purpose and explore the logic/process of the REST Service. We are using Humor API to create the random jokes, and the jokes created are translated to Italian using the Microsoft Translator and further the translated texts are converted to Speech using the Text to Speech APIs. 

All the APIs we are using are from Rapid API website so at first you have to create an account and sign up. 

After creating account, in order to use the APIs, you need to subscribe for each APIs (donâ€™t worry, they are free) and get your own API keys which you would require to use during the Examples and Assignment. 

The process of subscribing for different APIs are same. As a demo, we have shown you the process for only one API service. You can follow same process for other APIs. 

Here are the links and process of subscribing the APIS and getting your API keys.
